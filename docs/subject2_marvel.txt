Test Description:

Using the Javascript MVC (angular, ember, etc) of your choosing, create a website using the Public Marvel API's to drive the content of the website. (http://developer.marvel.com/).

Data:
- You can use what ever data that you have access to in the API. 
- Feel free to add in any other external data that you might need, as long as a majority of the data is coming from the Marvel API.

Libraries:
You can use any libraries that you want as long as they are open source.

Pages:
There are 3 required pages, but you can add as many pages as you see fit. 
- Home Page: Explains what the site is, and the ability to browse by creators or comics
- Creator page: Information about the creator, and anything else you want to add
- Comic page: Information about the comic, and anything else you want to add.

Structure:
- I don't care how you organize your code, as long as it is easy to find things and make changes in the future if needed.

Navigation:
- Make the site browsable, so people can click around to easily find more information about the comics they love.

Design:
- Start with bootstrap as a base, and add your own custom theme on top of it using .less
- make it look as nice as possible, but also make it usable for the visitors
- responsive design so it works on both mobile and desktop

End product:
- everything should be in a public repo on GitHub
- there should be a README to let us know everything we need to know about the project. How to start it up, how to contribute to it, what libraries are required, etc.

Bonus points:
- unit tests
- a Dockerfile we can use to create a docker container to run your project.
